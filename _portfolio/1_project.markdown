Whistling Woods Amboli
Because of the location of Amboli, which is situated at the northern tip of southern western ghats and southern tip of northern western Ghats, it has a unique biodiversity. Thus the approach was to design the rooms with minimal disturbance to the existing landscape.
Since the region receives the highest rainfall in the state, the idea here is to use laterite so that it can age gracefully and blend with the site, which itself is largely composed of the same stone.

 Every room is different in a spatial sense with arched openings, clay tiled floor, mezzanines, courts and verandahs to enhance the experience for guests.
Client being a biodiversity researcher and senior butterfly expert, each room is named on a butterfly and the interiors are designed by abstracting wing patterns of respected species. Also around the rooms host plants of these veriaties are planted to attract the species. This also helps in    
The interiors

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/1.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/2.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/3.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/5.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	This image can also have a caption. It's like magic. 
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above: 

	<div class="img_row">
	  <img class="col two" src="/img/6.jpg"/>
	  <img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg"/>
	</div>
