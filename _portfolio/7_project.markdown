Department in 2017, with an intent to showcase the newly formed sanctuary.

Living Waters Museum is a  project which aims to be a 
dynamic online repository of visualised knowledge of various practices, art, architecture and culture around water resources.

Temple trail map
Swapnagandha Resorts is situated in the picturesque valley of Chorla  in the state of Goa. The resort palns to organize heritage trails in the hinterland of Goa, for which a map was comissioned, which could be exhibited to the guests.

The idea here was to animate the temples with simple sketches and their charecteristic bright colours, with the 
backdrop of the lush state of Goa and its hills and the calm seas. This brought the temples to life from the setting of the map, highlighting thier different architectural styles. 

Medium used was ink, watercolour and photoshop.





House of Belgao
Houses of Belgao culminated into a four day event which organized-

A workshop for students, sensitizing them about elements of these houses through storymaking curated by artist, animator and architect Ajit Rao.

A panel discussion on the issue of heritage homes in the town, their status in the present times and re-thinking their purpose in the future.The panel presided by 

Ar.Gerard da Cunha,  Goa
Saili Palande Datar, Art Historian , Archeologist,  Pune
Ravindra Gundu Rao, Conservation Architect ,  Mysore

The exhibition was an attempt to start dailogues and conversation with the locals for a participatory decision about the adaptive reuse of these houses.
We structured modules for workshops and exercises using these houses as a palette for creative inspiration. 

The exhibition travelled to Pune in 2017   at Papertells Art Gallery through an invite from Ar.Girish Doshi where currently it is being showcased in various schools of achitecture in Pune.

Concept documentation and exhibition
Houses of Belgao is an independent project initiated by CICADA, a team of three architects- Tanvi Dhond, Suyash Khanolkar and Mohit Yalgi, born and brought up in Belgaum.

For us heritage houses of our town have always been very special - as landmarks, historic strongpoints, works of art and icons of our town. 

In the recent past these houses have been giving way to rapid and large scale development and no documentation or note of them remains. In the summer of 2014 we took on the project to document these houses, their unique characters, features, history of the family, material pallete and quality of spaces in a graphic art work form.

Not being a pure documentation we have taken the liberty to play, juxtapose and compose elements of the house to create visually appealing art work.



<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/1.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/2.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/3.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/5.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	This image can also have a caption. It's like magic. 
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


<br/><br/><br/>


The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above: 

	<div class="img_row">
	  <img class="col two" src="/img/6.jpg"/>
	  <img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg"/>
	</div>
