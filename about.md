<br/>
Cicada is a multidisciplinary design firm that works within the realms of art, architecture, interior, product, education, research and social impact. We strive for a design practice that is relevant and responsive to its time, people and place. 

‘Cicada’ emerged as a friendship between us while we were exploring the wilderness and villages surrounding our hometown - Belgaum. Travelling through these landscapes and learning about them imbibed in us a deep admiration for our natural and cultural heritage. Our design practice is informed and inspired by our travels and the lessons we learnt from people and places along the way. Cicada creates spaces, objects, visuals and interactions that are meaningful and grounded.
